		<p>Winter time is the best time to enjoy sweets and candies, isn't it? While it's freezing cold outside we relish sweets and chocolates and share them with those dearest to us. Now here is Winter Dream 2, that is all sweets but no calories - exactly the fun game to play in snug lodgings when the bitter cold prevents you from going out! In this beautiful and challenging match-three video game it is your task to combine at least three of the delicious sweets to make them disappear. If you play smart and manage to make more candy vanish with one move or even trigger combos that make different sorts of candy vanish, you can get tons of extra points and useful boosters, that make it much easier to achieve the levels goals. Always have an eye on the scores though, as you only have a limited amount of moves to reach win the level.</p>
